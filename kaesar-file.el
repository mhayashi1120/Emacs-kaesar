;;; Commentary:

;; ## Install:

;; Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and byte compile it if
;; desired. And put the following expression into your ~/.emacs.
;;
;;     (require 'kaesar-file)

;; ## Usage:

;; * Simply encrypt/decrypt file.
;; `kaesar-encrypt-file` <-> `kaesar-decrypt-file`

;;; TODO:
;; * brush up interface
;; * physical deletion raw file contents.
