AES (Rijndael) implementations for Emacs

This package provides AES algorithm to encrypt/decrypt Emacs
string. Supported algorithm desired to get interoperability with
openssl command. You can get decrypted text by that command if
you won't forget password.

## Install:

Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and
___!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BYTE COMPILE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!___
And put the following expression into your .emacs.

```
(require 'kaesar)
```

## Usage:

* To encrypt a well encoded string (High level API)
`kaesar-encrypt-string` <-> `kaesar-decrypt-string`

* To encrypt a unibyte string with algorithm (Middle level API)
`kaesar-encrypt-bytes` <-> `kaesar-decrypt-bytes`

* To encrypt a unibyte with algorithm (Low level API)
`kaesar-encrypt` <-> `kaesar-decrypt`

## Sample:

* To encrypt my secret
  Please ensure that do not forget `clear-string` you want to hide.

```
(defvar my-secret nil)
```

```
(let ((raw-string "My Secret"))
  (setq my-secret (kaesar-encrypt-string raw-string))
  (clear-string raw-string))
```

* To decrypt `my-secret`

```
(kaesar-decrypt-string my-secret)
```

## NOTE:

Why kaesar?
This package previously named `cipher/aes` but ELPA cannot handle
such package name.  So, I had to change the name but `aes` package
already exists. (That is faster than this package!)  I continue to
consider the new name which contains "aes" string. There is the
ancient cipher algorithm caesar
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher
 K`aes`ar is change the first character of Caesar. There is no
meaning more than containing `aes` word.

How to suppress password prompt?
There is no official way to suppress that prompt. If you want to
know more information, please read `kaesar-password` doc string.

kaesar-file.el
==============

## Install:

Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and byte compile it if
desired. And put the following expression into your ~/.emacs.

```
(require 'kaesar-file)
```

## Usage:

Simply encrypt or decrypt file using `kaesar-file-encrypt` and `kaesar-file-encrypt`:

```
> (kaesar-file-encrypt "/path/to/file.txt")
nil
```

```
> (kaesar-file-decrypt "/path/to/file.txt")
nil
```
